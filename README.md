# ü¶à Advanced Shark Telemetry Dashboard

This repository hosts the **front-end visualization interface (Dashboard)** for the **Advanced Shark Monitoring Chip**, our innovative hardware project focused on deep-sea marine biotelemetry.

The core mission of this dashboard is to transform complex, raw data collected by underwater sensors (like heart rate, pH levels, and acceleration) into a simple, accessible, and actionable format for researchers, conservationists, and wildlife managers. It serves as the user's **simple screen** to interpret the shark's "marine black box."

## üöÄ Key Features and Functionality

The dashboard provides a clear window into the shark's secret life, displaying key information in an intuitive layout:

* **Physiological Monitoring:** Displays **real-time or historical heart rate** data, allowing researchers to analyze stress levels, energetic costs of behavior (like migration), and overall health.
* **Behavioral Ecology Mapping:** Uses **accelerometer** data (motion) and GPS regions to visually map and highlight specific **feeding events** and swimming patterns over geographic regions.
* **Environmental Analysis:** Presents continuous readings of **water pH** and **temperature** in aggregation areas, providing crucial insight into how the immediate environment affects the animal's physiology.
* **Simple Visualization:** Data is presented via clean, responsive charts, interactive maps, and easy-to-read gauges, eliminating the need for manual data processing by the user.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack (Front-end)

This dashboard is designed for speed, responsiveness, and clear data presentation.

| Category | Technology (Suggested) | Purpose |
